///////
Objectives and key results, or OKRs, have become one of the most popular frameworks for teams looking to plan and measure the success of their work. With this system, leaders at each level of the organization start by defining high-level, qualitative, inspirational goals, called “objectives.” They then define who will be the user or the consumer of their team’s work, and determine what behavioral changes they would expect to see in those consumers that could be used to quantify whether the team is achieving their high-level goals. These quantifiable outcomes are called “key results,” and are used to measure how successful teams are with respect to their objectives.

This approach keeps planning and progress-tracking focused on the impact the work is having, rather than micromanaging the specific work that teams are doing on a daily basis. Because of this, it is an effective mechanism for aligning top-down strategy with bottom-up, team-level commitments to intermediate goals in support of that strategy. The strength of OKRs explicitly lies in de-emphasizing specific tasks, and instead emphasizing the value that those tasks deliver.
